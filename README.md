# ThingM Blink(1) API

A simple Rest API for the ThingM Blink1 Device that allows for network control using Python, Flask, and Docker.

In this project, I use the existing python library for the ThingM blink1 to create a flask API, so that I can control the blink1 device over the network.

This will only work if you have a ThingM device connected to your PC.
Tested on Linux only.
Intended to be run in a docker container.
